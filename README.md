# Snake-Game-using-A-star-Algorithm
we have implemented the Snake Game using Python and Pygame library. Additionally, we have integrated an AI algorithm, specifically the A* algorithm, to control the movement of the snake.
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the screen.The A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in artificial intelligence and computer science. It is used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid while considering the cost of movement between nodes. The algorithm is based on a heuristic function that estimates the cost of reaching the goal from any given node.
How it is used in the code:
In our Snake Game implementation, we use the A* algorithm to guide the snake towards the food. Here's how the algorithm is utilized in our code:
Initialization: We initialize the A* algorithm with the starting position of the snake's head, the position of the food, and the positions of obstacles (i.e., the snake's body).
Heuristic Function: We define a heuristic function that estimates the distance between two points on the grid. In our case, we use the Manhattan distance heuristic, which calculates the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.
Get Neighbors Function: We define a function to get the neighboring cells of a given cell on the grid. These neighboring cells are potential moves for the snake.
Move Snake: Based on the path generated by the A* algorithm, the snake's head moves towards the next cell in the path.
